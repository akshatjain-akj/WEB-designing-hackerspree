# WEB-designing-hackerspree
layout base for web development for sharing of resources and project and build an end to end connection with team and their mentor.

AS our inspiring seniors specially ATISHAY sir and had launched the hackerspree from this year 
so,
our team developed an idea to fill the gap between the mentor and team forever by creating an own platform where everyone get their resources to study and and can talk to their mentor share their projects and idea on one platform instead of so many github links.
we are progressing to build a complete website where evrey mentor and team will be registered and can acess resources and mentors can guide them throuh this.
our team members know front end and we have started to learn javscript and python for backend as well as machine learningso that we can make a full fledge website which will make the job easier for both mentor and teams and mentor can keep an eye on all prtojecs undergoing and guide time to time and will lead us to victory


our main idea is to built a website :
>to provide and end to end connection between teams and mentors.
>a website where team can upload their projects and mentors can guide them time to time.
>a chat box where teams can post doubt and other teams or mentor can solve them 
>a website where we can provide resources links from where one can do courses to excel in the field he opted.

this can only be possible under valuable inputs as we have made the team recently and have no such experience.
a ray of light from our mentors will help us to achieve our dreams.


note: we have started to learn backend and under our senior guidance we are sure we can make this dream come true.
(we are working on frontend and had started to learn backend and will complete this project soon!!)
thankyou!
