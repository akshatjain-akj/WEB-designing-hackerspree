    <p id="p1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Machine learning</strong> is an application of <em><strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong></em> that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. <strong>Machine learning </strong> focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.</p>

            Continuous Improvement
        </h3>
            <p>Machine Learning algorithms are capable of learning from the data we provide. As new data is provided, the modelâ€™s accuracy and efficiency to make decisions improve with subsequent training. Giants like Amazon, Walmart, etc collect a huge volume of new data every day. The accuracy of finding associated products or recommendation engine improves with this huge amount of training data available.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="box2"><h3>
            
            Automation for everything
        </h3>
            <p>A very powerful utility of Machine Learning is its ability to automate various decision-making tasks. This frees up a lot of time for developers to use their time to more productive use. For example, some common use we see in our daily life is social media sentiment analysis and chatbots. The moment a negative tweet is made related to a product or service of a Company, a chatbot instantly replies as first-level customer support. Machine Learning is changing the world with its automation for almost everything we can think of.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="box3"><h3>

            Trends and patterns identification
        </h3>
            <p>This advantage is a no brainer. All of us interested in Machine Learning technology are well aware of how the various Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforced learning algorithms can be used for various classification and regression problems. We identify various trends and patterns with a huge amount of data using this technology. For example, Amazon analyzes the buying patterns and search trends of its customers and predicts products for them using Machine Learning algorithms.</p>

            <h3>

                Wide range of applications
            </h3>
            <p>Machine Learning is used in every industry these days, for example from Defence to Education. Companies generate profits, cut costs, automate, predict the future, analyze trends and patterns from the past data, and many more. Applications like GPS Tracking for traffic, Email spam filtering, text prediction, spell check and correction, etc are a few used widely these days. Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence, the latest trends and applications can be found in Artificial Intelligence Trends in 2020.</p>
